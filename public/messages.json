Regardless of what I go through, it brings me back out of whatever circumstances I &#039;m in, and I feel alive again. Something about his sound feels so deeply connected to what it feels like to live the human experience. I &#039;m forever grateful. He and his music were blessings to this world and live on through me and others like me. His music feels like home. I &#039;m welcome"

      "testimonial": "Avicii was a big part of the music I knew growing up. I remember hearing the likes of Wake Me Up in school, The Nights when I used to play FIFA. The music was just something else for me, a way for me to just lose myself in the music, just vibing, forgetting all my worries and everything. There is very little music that has had that effect on me before and ever since. It gives me so much energy and joy to listen to him and just makes me forget everything in life, from the day I found him."

I’ve met so many amazing friends and artists. His music will forever carry on. Hope I see him when I pass away some day. I truly love the edm community and I hope it gets better. Rip Avicii and all other festival members who lost their lives to anything. Forever plur. Music will carry on even after death."
